  <h5><b>Early Life</b></h5>
  <div class="md-width">

    Elizabeth Gilbert was born in Waterbury, Connecticut in 1969, and grew up on a small family Christmas tree farm. She attended New York University, where she studied political science by day and worked on her short stories by night. After college, she spent several years traveling around the country, working in bars, diners and ranches, collecting experiences to transform into fiction.

    <h5><b><i>Eat, Pray, Love </i>Journey</b></h5>

    <p>The story cherished by millions that brought Gilbert to fame in 2006 begins in Italy, where she spends the days learning the Italian language, enjoying the delicious local food, and making new friends.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, on the eve of a new year, she flies to a remote ashram in India that is headed by her spritiual guru. Here, under the instruction of her guru and with the help of man named Richard from Texas, she spends three months learning to meditate and grow closer to God while at the same time making peace with many of the internal troubles that had caused her so much grief.</p>
    <p>In Indonesia, Gilbert continues her spiritual journey with a Balinese medicine man, Ketut Lyer, in an attempt to find a balance between the joys of both the earth and the divine. Here, with her landlord Wayan and other Balinese residents, she continues to make more friends and even finds a romance in the midst of it all.
